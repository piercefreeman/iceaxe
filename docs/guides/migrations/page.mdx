# Migrations

Whether you're starting a new project or already have a table schema
in place, you're eventually going to modify your TableBase schema and
need that reflected in your database. Instead of writing this logic by
handle, we bundle a series of utilities that handle this manipulation
for you in a safe and predictable way.

You'll typically want to call your migration commands from your command line. So
we can go ahead and import your CLI library of choice and write some wrapper
code on top of our utility functions. We start by defining our project name (the
same one that's declared in your pyproject.toml file) alongside a helper function
to get a connection to your database.

For a real project, you'll want to grab these values from environment variables.

```python
# cli.py
import asyncio
import asyncpg
from click import command, option

from iceaxe import DBConnection
from iceaxe.migrations.cli import handle_generate, handle_apply, handle_rollback

from myproject import models # noqa: F401

PROJECT = "myproject"

async def get_connection():
    return DBConnection(
        await asyncpg.connect(
            host="localhost",
            port=5432,
            user="db_user",
            password="yoursecretpassword",
            database="your_db",
        )
    )
```

Now we can write the CLI functions that will actually be called. Iceaxe takes
care of the core logic, so our job here is just to expose it to the command line.

```python
@command()
@option("--message", help="A message to attach to the migration")
def generate(message: str | None):
    async def _inner():
        await handle_generate(PROJECT, await get_connection(), message=message)
    asyncio.run(_inner())

@command()
def apply():
    async def _inner():
        await handle_apply(PROJECT, await get_connection())
    asyncio.run(_inner())

@command()
def rollback():
    async def _inner():
        await handle_rollback(PROJECT, await get_connection())
    asyncio.run(_inner())
```

Great, now just modify your pyproject.toml file to make these callable. If you're
using `uv`, you can add the following to your `project.scripts` section:

```toml
[project.scripts]
migrate-generate = "myproject.cli:generate"
migrate-apply = "myproject.cli:apply"
migrate-rollback = "myproject.cli:rollback"
```

## Generating migrations

Let's say we currently have a simple Employee table that's defined in our
database. It has an auto-incrementing ID and a name.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| id          | int       | PRIMARY KEY |
| name        | varchar   |             |

We want to add an age to each user record, so we modify our TableBase schema
to include this new field.

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase, Field

class Employee(TableBase):
    id: int | None = Field(primary_key=True, default=None)
    name: str
    age: int  # new field
```

When we call our `migrate-generate` from the CLI, Iceaxe will do the following:

- Use the database connection to introspect the current schema
- Compare the current schema to the new schema, creating a migration pathway
  to convert one to the other
- Generate a migration file that will add the `age` column to the `employee` table

```bash
$ uv run migrate-generate

Generating migration to current schema
New migration added: rev_1729278706.py
```

It places the following file in your `myprojects/migrations` directory:

```python
from iceaxe.migrations.migrator import Migrator
from iceaxe.migrations.migration import MigrationRevisionBase
from iceaxe.schemas.actions import ColumnType

class MigrationRevision(MigrationRevisionBase):
    """
    Migration auto-generated on 2024-10-18T12:11:46.941324.

    Context: None

    """
    up_revision: str = "1729278608"
    down_revision: str | None = None

    async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
        await migrator.actor.add_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age", explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER, explicit_data_is_list=False, custom_data_type=None)
        await migrator.actor.add_not_null(table_name="employee", column_name="age")

    async def down(self, migrator: Migrator):
        await migrator.actor.drop_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age")
```

This file contains the logic to transform your current schema to the new schema (`up`) as well
as to undo those changes and revert back to the original schema (`down`). This down logic
lets you rollback changes that potentially break your application.

You can modify these migration functions to include additional logic, such as defaulting
default values for the new column or migrating data from one column to another. For this
`up` function we'd probably want to insert our known ages for our employees.

```python
async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
    await migrator.actor.add_column(table_name="employee", column_name="age", explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER, explicit_data_is_list=False, custom_data_type=None)

    # Insert known ages for employees
    await migrator.db_connection.exec(
        ...
    )

    await migrator.actor.add_not_null(table_name="employee", column_name="age")
```

## Column Type Changes and Autocast

When you change the data type of an existing column in your TableBase schema, Iceaxe will automatically generate a `modify_column_type` migration. By default, these auto-generated migrations include automatic type casting (`autocast=True`) to handle data conversion between incompatible types.

### Automatic Type Conversion

Consider this scenario where you want to change a text field to store numeric data:

```python
# Before
class Product(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    price: str  # Originally stored as text

# After  
class Product(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    price: int  # Now we want it as an integer
```

Iceaxe will generate a migration like this:

```python
async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
    await migrator.actor.modify_column_type(
        table_name="product", 
        column_name="price", 
        explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER,
        autocast=True  # Automatically added
    )
```

The `autocast=True` parameter tells PostgreSQL to automatically convert existing data using an appropriate `USING` clause. This handles conversions like:

- String to numeric types (`"123"` â†’ `123`)
- String to boolean (`"true"` â†’ `True`)
- String to date/time types (`"2023-01-01"` â†’ `date(2023, 1, 1)`)
- String to UUID, JSON, and other specialized types
- Scalar to array types (`42` â†’ `[42]`)
- Custom enum conversions

### Customizing Autocast Behavior

If you need to customize the type conversion behavior, you can manually edit the generated migration:

```python
async def up(self, migrator: Migrator):
    # Disable autocast for manual control
    await migrator.actor.modify_column_type(
        table_name="product", 
        column_name="price", 
        explicit_data_type=ColumnType.INTEGER,
        autocast=False
    )
    
    # Or add custom data transformation logic
    await migrator.db_connection.conn.execute("""
        UPDATE product 
        SET price = CASE 
            WHEN price ~ '^[0-9]+$' THEN price::integer
            ELSE 0
        END
    """)
```

### Supported Type Conversions

The autocast feature supports most common PostgreSQL type conversions:

| From Type | To Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| VARCHAR/TEXT | INTEGER/BIGINT | `"123"` â†’ `123` |
| VARCHAR/TEXT | BOOLEAN | `"true"` â†’ `true` |
| VARCHAR/TEXT | DATE/TIMESTAMP | `"2023-01-01"` â†’ `2023-01-01` |
| VARCHAR/TEXT | UUID | `"550e8400-..."` â†’ UUID |
| VARCHAR/TEXT | JSON/JSONB | `'{"key":"value"}'` â†’ JSON |
| VARCHAR/TEXT | Custom Enums | `"ACTIVE"` â†’ enum value |
| Scalar Types | Array Types | `42` â†’ `[42]` |
| Compatible numeric types | Direct conversion | `123` â†’ `123.0` |

### Migration Safety

Auto-generated migrations with `autocast=True` are designed to be safe for most common scenarios. However, you should always:

1. **Review generated migrations** before applying them to production
2. **Test migrations** on a copy of your production data first
3. **Backup your database** before applying type-changing migrations
4. **Consider data validation** - autocast will fail if data cannot be converted

If you have data that cannot be automatically converted (e.g., non-numeric strings when converting to integers), the migration will fail and you'll need to clean up the data first or provide custom conversion logic.

## Applying migrations

When you're happy with your migration, you can apply it to your database by running
the `migrate-apply` command. This migration will apply any unapplied migrations in
your migrations folder up to the last revision.

```bash
$ uv run migrate-apply

ðŸš€ Applied 1729278608 in 0.02s
```

## Undoing migrations

If you need to rollback a migration, you can run the `migrate-rollback` command. This
will undo 1 migration at a time, starting with the most recent migration.

```bash
$ poetry run migrate-rollback

ðŸªƒ Rolled back migration to None in 0.01s
```
