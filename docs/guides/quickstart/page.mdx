# Quickstart

## Installation

If you're using `uv` to manage your dependencies:

```bash
uv add iceaxe
```

Otherwise install with pip:

```bash
pip install iceaxe
```

## Usage

Define your models as a `TableBase` subclass:

```python
from iceaxe import TableBase

class Person(TableBase):
    id: int
    name: str
    age: int
```

TableBase is a subclass of Pydantic's `BaseModel`, so you get all of the validation and Field customization
out of the box. We provide our own `Field` constructor that adds database-specific configuration. For instance, to make the
`id` field a primary key / auto-incrementing you can do:

```python
from iceaxe import Field

class Person(TableBase):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str
    age: int
```

Okay now you have a model. How do you interact with it?

Databases are based on a few core primitives to insert data, update it, and fetch it out again.
To do so you'll need a _database connection_, which is a connection over the network from your code
to your Postgres database. The `DBConnection` is the core class for all ORM actions against the database.

```python
from iceaxe import DBConnection
import asyncpg

conn = DBConnection(
    await asyncpg.connect(
        host="localhost",
        port=5432,
        user="db_user",
        password="yoursecretpassword",
        database="your_db",
    )
)
```

The Person class currently just lives in memory. To back it with a full
database table, we can run raw SQL or run a [migration](/iceaxe/guides/migrations) to
add it automatically:

```python
await conn.conn.execute(
    """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL
    )
    """
)
```

### Inserting Data

Instantiate object classes as you normally do:

```python
people = [
    Person(name="Alice", age=30),
    Person(name="Bob", age=40),
    Person(name="Charlie", age=50),
]
await conn.insert(people)

print(people[0].id) # 1
print(people[1].id) # 2
```

Because we're using an auto-incrementing primary key, the `id` field will be populated after the insert.
Iceaxe will automatically update the object in place with the newly assigned value.

### Updating data

Now that we have these lovely people, let's modify them.

```python
person = people[0]
person.name = "Blice"
```

Right now, we have a Python object that's out of state with the database. But that's often okay. We can inspect it
and further write logic - it's fully decoupled from the database.

```python
def ensure_b_letter(person: Person):
    if person.name[0].lower() != "b":
        raise ValueError("Name must start with 'B'")

ensure_b_letter(person)
```

To sync the values back to the database, we can call `update`:

```python
await conn.update([person])
```

If we were to query the database directly, we see that the name has been updated:

```
id | name  | age
----+-------+-----
  1 | Blice |  31
  2 | Bob   |  40
  3 | Charlie | 50
```

But no other fields have been touched. This lets a potentially concurrent process
modify `Alice`'s record - say, updating the age to 31. By the time we update the data, we'll
change the name but nothing else. Under the hood we do this by tracking the fields that
have been modified in-memory and creating a targeted UPDATE to modify only those values.

### Selecting data

To select data, we can use a `QueryBuilder`. For a shortcut to `select` query functions,
you can also just import select directly. This method takes the desired value parameters
and returns a list of the desired objects.

```python
from iceaxe import select

query = select(Person).where(Person.name == "Blice", Person.age > 25)
results = await conn.exec(query)
```

If we inspect the typing of `results`, we see that it's a `list[Person]` objects. This matches
the typehint of the `select` function. You can also target columns directly:

```python
query = select((Person.id, Person.name)).where(Person.age > 25)
results = await conn.exec(query)
```

This will return a list of tuples, where each tuple is the id and name of the person: `list[tuple[int, str]]`.

We support most of the common SQL operations. Just like the results, these are typehinted
to their proper types as well. Static typecheckers and your IDE will throw an error if you try to compare
a string column to an integer, for instance. A more complex example of a query:

```python
query = select((
    Person.id,
    FavoriteColor,
)).join(
    FavoriteColor,
    Person.id == FavoriteColor.person_id,
).where(
    Person.age > 25,
    Person.name == "Blice",
).order_by(
    Person.age.desc(),
).limit(10)
results = await conn.exec(query)
```

As expected this will deliver results - and typehint - as a `list[tuple[int, FavoriteColor]]`
